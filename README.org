* htts

This is just a little script to read lines from stdin (utilizing Haskeline, so you have nice keyindings) and output them in German (currently hard-coded) via mpv to your speakers.

* Installation

Not needed, just install [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] and [[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] and run the program.

* Usage

Type something, have it read out to you.
